# Accessibility-and-Optimization

 ## A client wanted to rework their current code to meet accessibility standards and is optimized for search engines. 

 ## We started by consolidating the code and making classes in the CSS to clean up the code.

 ## We changed the "div" to "main" & "section" to show the main body of the website.

 ## We added "aside" to add the side bar information.

 ## We added class "benefits" to consolidate the code.

 ## We changed the ID's "search-engine-optimization", "online-reputation-management", & "social-media-marketing" to "Information" to help consolidate the CSS.
